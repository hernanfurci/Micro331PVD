    "# *Theory of thin film deposition*\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thin film** is a layer of material whose thickness spans from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers. Being a pivotal step in microfabrication processes, thin film deposition enables the assembly of the various materials that constitute the device. Nevertheless, thin film deposition mainly focuses on the application of materials, necessitating the use of other techniques (e.g., etching, lift-off) to sculpt the layer into its desired form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although multiple techniques can deposit identical materials, each is accompanied by its unique constraints, resulting in layers with distinct properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PVD** comprises a spectrum of vacuum deposition techniques that are employed to produce thin films and coatings on a diverse range of substrates, including metals, ceramics, glass, and polymers. PVD is characterized by a process in which a material undergoes a phase transition: from a condensed phase to a vapor phase, and then back to a thin film condensed phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E-Beam Evaporation\n",
    "\n",
    "**E-Beam Evaporation** is a method that involves the evaporation of a material (be it grains, pieces, or tablets) situated in a crucible heated by a highly energetic electron beam. The wafers are placed on a dome at the top of the machine, with the face to receive the material facing down. The crucible is positionned at the bottom along with its heating system and the shutter. During the whole process the chamber is closed and pumped at very low pressures to allow the evaporated particles to travel freely through space, with low collision probability, and to ensure the purity of the deposition.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The substrate (wafer) is spaced at distance ranging from 10 centimeters to more than a meter depending on the application. This allows for very good film uniformities.\n",
    "Quartz resonators trategically placed inside the chamber allow to measure the deposited thickness, with precision in the order of the tenth of angstrom. \n",

From 12 seconds til the end: the materials (the crucibles) which are installed at the bottom next to an electron beam gun, multiple materials are installed to allow for multi-layer deposition without having to pump back the chamber.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sputtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sputtering** is a process initiated by a plasma; the ions generated are accelerated towards the target's surface (a block of material intended for deposition onto your substrate). Some atoms are ejected from the surface due to ion bombardment, and these sputtered atoms redeposit onto the sample surfaces to form a thin film. The three primary types of sputtering are DC Sputtering, RF Sputtering, and Magnetron Sputtering, each differing by the material that can be sputtered and the effects on the machine's wear.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The substrate is often placed at ranges from 2 to 15 centimeters from the target.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As there is a plasma inside the chamber there aren't any suitable sensors which can be used. The deposition rate is assumed constant for a given set of parameters, so the thickness is defined by the process duration.\n",
