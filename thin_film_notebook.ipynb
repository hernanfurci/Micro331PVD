    "# *Theory of thin film deposition*\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thin film** is a layer of material whose thickness spans from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers. Being a pivotal step in microfabrication processes, thin film deposition enables the assembly of the various materials that constitute the device. Nevertheless, thin film deposition mainly focuses on the application of materials, necessitating the use of other techniques (e.g., etching, lift-off) to sculpt the layer into its desired form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although multiple techniques can deposit identical materials, each is accompanied by its unique constraints, resulting in layers with distinct properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PVD** comprises a spectrum of vacuum deposition techniques that are employed to produce thin films and coatings on a diverse range of substrates, including metals, ceramics, glass, and polymers. PVD is characterized by a process in which a material undergoes a phase transition: from a condensed phase to a vapor phase, and then back to a thin film condensed phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E-Beam Evaporation\n",
    "\n",
    "**E-Beam Evaporation** is a method that involves the evaporation of a material (be it grains, pieces, or tablets) situated in a crucible heated by a highly energetic electron beam. the wafers are placed upuside down on a dome at the top of the machine. The crucible is positionned at the bottom along with its heating system and the shutter. During the whole process the chamber is closed and pumped at very low pressures to allow the process to happend and to insure the purity of the deposition.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The substrat (wafer) is spaced at distance ranging from 10 centimeters to more then a meter depending on the application. This allows for very good film uniformities.\n",
    "This type of process allow for the use of quartz resonators to measure the thickness which have a precision in the order of the tenth of angstrom. \n",

    "### Sputtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sputtering** is a process initiated by a plasma; the ions generated are accelerated towards the target's surface (a block of material intended for deposition onto your substrate). Some atoms are ejected from the surface due to ion bombardment, and these sputtered atoms redeposit onto the sample surfaces to form a thin film. The three primary types of sputtering are DC Sputtering, RF Sputtering, and Magnetron Sputtering, each differing by the material that can be sputtered and the effects on the machine's wear.\n",

    "The substrat is often placed at ranges from 2 to 15 centimeters from the target.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "* __Distance__ : it is the distance between the crucible and the wafer. It is the most significant parameter (when you have the right pressure and a stable evaporation) in an evaporation process. \n",
    "* __Wafer size__: 5, 10 or 16 cm of diameters. Larger wafers allow for better scalability of the process but lead to less uniform processes (also the case for other steps than thin film deposition). Smaller wafer are mainly used for research where even chips of 10 by 10 mm squares are used. Allowing for a reduced price while insuring uniform processes.\n",
    "* __Source approximation__: The source can be approximated to be a point or a surface. When the source is assumed to be a point all evaporation is assumued to come from it while surface evaporation assumes the evaporated material can come from all of the sruface of the crucible. In practice the evaporation comes from a surface which size depends on the material and the power used to the evaporation.\n",

The parameters of the electron beam gun or the heating system aren't talked about as they aren't relevant to the study of evaporation in the context of microfabrication._\n",

On the left you have a 3d surface of the wafer and on the right a 2d surface where you can access the exact thickness deposited as a function of the distance of the points from the center of the wafer. For both plot, mind the scale. The aspect ratio can be activated and deactivated for the left figure.\n",
